fuzzy-utils

If you have chosen to use the second hasing method (i.e. BerkeleyDB),
then you also have the following at your disposal:

fuzzy-find [--delete] hash|filename
    This utility searches the DB files for the digest hash 
    (from debug output) and prints out the information stored
    in the DB file.  It is usefull to check how many times an
    image has matched.  Also, with the optional --delete option,
    you can remove the image from the DB file

fuzzy-stats [days] [images]
    This utility generates basic statistics taken from the DB files
    regarding matches made [days] ago (0 by default == today) and 
    shows some information of the top [images] (5 by default)

fuzzy-cleantmp [hours]
    If you decide to keep debug information of the work SpamAssassin
    is doing, tempfiles tend to pile up.  This utility can help by 
    removing 'old' files (older than [hours] hours (12 by default)).
    This can safely be placed in CRON to keep your tempdir manageable

TODO:
    Right now, the names for each DB file is hardcoded. If you change
    the default settings in FuzzyOcr.cf, you must update these utilities
    so that they can process the 'right' files.
