# FuzzyOcr
FuzzyOcr is a plugin for [SpamAssassin][1] written by Christian Holler and Jorge Valdes, distributed under the [Apache License v.2.0][5], and is currently being distributed as a package by Linux distros such as [Debian][2]. 

# Disclaimer
I am neither of the creators.

My main contribution is that I found out reading the spamassassin mailing list that it is [unmaintained][3]. Further investigation told me the last release of FuzzyOcr was 3.6.0. Using the wayback machine, I found a [2012][4] page from its original wiki, http://fuzzyocr.own-hero.net/ (site has been down for a while; expect one day the Nigerian Prince will snatch it), stating that

> This project is UNMAINTAINED as of 2009-06-01. Use it at your own risk. If you want to fork this project, drop me a note (decoder[at]own-hero.net).
 
I found a [tarball][2] with its source code, grabbed it, and now am placing it here hoping that will allow others to continue developing/upgrading it.
